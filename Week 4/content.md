📖 1. Meghamala: IIT Kharagpur’s Private Cloud ☁️
What is Meghamala? 🤔
Meghamala is IIT Kharagpur’s private cloud platform, built on OpenStack, designed to provide on-demand compute and storage for the institute’s research community. It’s hosted at the Computer and Informatics Centre and offers a one-stop solution for computational needs.

Purpose: Supports research by offering scalable resources (VMs, storage) with one-click access.
Analogy: Think of Meghamala as a spaceship hangar—researchers (pilots) request VMs (ships) tailored to their missions (projects), launched instantly via OpenStack.
Key Features:
Built on OpenStack for flexibility and scalability.
Hardware includes node servers and auxiliary storage.
Managed by a team of students, engineers, and faculty (e.g., Prof. Soumya K. Ghosh).



Hardware and Setup 🖥️

Location: Computer and Informatics Centre, IIT Kharagpur.
Components:
Node Servers: Physical machines running VMs.
Aux Storage: Additional storage for data persistence.


Exam Tip: MCQs may ask about Meghamala’s purpose (research support) or platform (OpenStack). 🎯

Meghamala Team 👥

Students: Shubham Jain, Shureans Pagariva (B.Tech), Arindam Roy, Chetadan Mitra (PhD).
Past Members: Harshit Gopla, Adhish Kale, Abhijeet Deshmukh.
Engineers: Alok Chattopadhyay, Asit Baran Das.
Faculty: Prof. Soumya K. Ghosh, Shamik Sural (CSE Dept.).
Goal: Expand the team to foster learning and innovation.
Analogy: The team is like a starship crew, with students as engineers, faculty as captains, and engineers as tech specialists keeping the cloud running.
Exam Tip: Know key names (e.g., Soumya K. Ghosh) and the team’s role (development, maintenance). ❓


🛠️ 2. Meghamala Services: VMs4U ⚙️
Meghamala offers VMs4U, a service providing virtual machines (VMs) with different configurations for research needs.
VM Configurations 📊



VM Type
vCPUs
RAM
Ephemeral Storage
Use Case



IITKGP_large
8
16 GB
80 GB
Heavy compute tasks


IITKGP_small
2
4 GB
40 GB
Light research tasks



Operating System: Ubuntu 14.04 (default).
Duration: VMs allocated for up to 90 days.
Analogy: VMs are like rental spaceships—choose a small shuttle (IITKGP_small) for quick missions or a large cruiser (IITKGP_large) for complex research.

VM Request Process 📝
Users (faculty/researchers) submit a VMs4U Request Form with:

Details: Faculty name, department, designation, contact (phone/email).
Purpose: Research project description.
VM Specs: Preferred VM name, type (small/large), number of VMs, duration.
Security: CAPTCHA code for verification.
Steps:
Fill form via Meghamala portal.
Submit query.
OpenStack provisions VM using Nova, Neutron, Cinder, etc. (Week 3 workflow).


Analogy: Requesting a VM is like booking a flight—fill out a form, specify needs (economy or business class), and the airline (OpenStack) assigns your seat (VM).
Exam Tip: Memorize the request form fields and VM types for MCQs. 🎯


📊 3. OpenStack Dashboard: Usage Monitoring 📈
Meghamala uses OpenStack Horizon (dashboard) to monitor resource usage, critical for private cloud management.
Usage Summary 📋

Metrics:
VCPUs: Virtual CPUs allocated (e.g., 128 total).
RAM: Memory used (e.g., 30400 MB).
Disk: Storage consumed (e.g., 2855 GB).
VCPU Hours: Compute usage over time (e.g., 650.30 hours).
Disk GB Hours: Storage usage over time (e.g., 64741 GB-hours).


Example:
Instance: nikOC (2 vCPUs, 4 GB RAM, 40 GB disk).
Project: admin (30 instances, 30468 VCPU hours, 54662.52 GB-hours).


Time Query: Select a period (e.g., June 1-30, 2017) to view usage in YYYY-MM-DD format.

Limit Summary 🚨

Volumes: Used 21 out of 200.
Instances: No limit specified, but 30 active.
Analogy: The dashboard is like a spaceship control panel, showing fuel (VCPUs), cargo (disk), and flight hours (usage metrics) to ensure the mission stays on track.
Exam Tip: Focus on metrics (VCPUs, RAM, Disk) and their units (hours, GB-hours) for MCQs. ❓


☁️ 4. Google Cloud Platform (GCP) App Engine Deployment 🌐
Week 4 briefly introduces GCP App Engine, a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) for deploying web applications, contrasting with Meghamala’s Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS).
What is App Engine? 🤔

Definition: A fully managed platform for building and deploying web apps without managing servers.
Features:
Auto-scaling, load balancing, and zero server management.
Supports languages like Python, Java, Node.js.


Analogy: App Engine is like a self-driving car—you write the app (set the destination), and GCP handles the infrastructure (driving).

Deployment Process 🚀

Install Google Cloud SDK: Download and initialize for your OS (e.g., Windows).
Configure Project: Set up a GCP project (e.g., gcp-pythonapp).
Deploy App:
Command: gcloud app deploy app.yaml --project gcp-pythonapp
app.yaml: Config file specifying runtime, handlers, etc.


View App: gcloud app browse opens the app URL (e.g., https://gcp-pythonapp.appspot.com).
Monitor: Use App Engine Dashboard for logs and performance.

Products List: https://cloud.google.com/products/compute-engine/
Google APIs: https://fethidilmi.blogspot.com/2013/01/understanding-googleapis.html
Analogy: Deploying an app is like launching a satellite—write the code, send it to GCP’s orbit (App Engine), and monitor from mission control (dashboard).
Exam Tip: Know the gcloud commands and App Engine’s role (PaaS) vs. OpenStack (IaaS). 🎯
