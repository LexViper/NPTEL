- **AR Apps**: Image recognition for Google Glass vibes. 🥽

### Key Features 🎯
- ⚡ **Speedy Apps**: Build & update fast with cloud services.
- 🌐 **Shared Resources**: No storage/processing limits.
- 🔄 **Data Integration**: Grab data from anywhere, securely.
- 🛡️ **Reliable**: Cloud backups keep things safe.
- 📱 **Multi-Platform**: Works on any device via APIs.

### MCC Workflow 🛠️
- **Profiler**: Tracks app stats (time, power, network). 📊
- **Solver**: Picks what runs on phone vs. cloud. 🧠
- **Synchronizer**: Merges results, keeps it seamless. 🔗
- **Dynamic Offloading**: Profiles, splits, migrates, syncs for max efficiency. 🚚

### Pros & Cons ⚖️
- **Pros**: Saves battery 🔋, speeds up execution 🏃‍♂️.
- **Cons**: Network lag can slow things down 📶.

## Geospatial Cloud Computing 🌍☁️

### What’s the Deal? 🗺️
Geospatial cloud handles **huge** spatial data & metadata for GIS apps. It’s like a global map party! 🎉

### Why Geospatial Cloud? 🌐
- 📊 **Big Data**: Tons of spatial data & metadata.
- 🤝 **Sharing**: Orgs want to share spatial services.
- ⚙️ **Services**: Need orchestration & standards.
- 💻 **Less Infra**: No need for heavy GIS setups.
- 🔄 **Portability**: Easy to move services across VMs.

### Cloud Advantages 💼
- 📈 **Scalability**: Grow as needed.
- ⚙️ **Resource Use**: Optimize servers, storage, networks.
- 💸 **Low Costs**: Pay-as-you-go, no big upfront CAPEX.
- 🌱 **Green**: Cuts carbon footprints.
- 🤝 **Data Sharing**: Easy exchange with clients.

### Geospatial Cloud Architecture 🏗️
- **Enterprise GIS (eGIS)**: Collection of GIS instances.
- **Services**:
  - **Resource**: Allocates VMs, networks, monitoring. 🖥️
  - **Data**: Manages user/system data. 📂
  - **Interface**: User-facing, handles auth & tools. 🖱️

### Challenges ⚠️
- 🗄️ **Spatial DBs**: Tough to implement & scale.
- 🏠 **Multi-Tenancy**: Managing multiple users.
