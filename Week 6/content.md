# Cloud Computing Security Content Summary 🚀

This document from **Prof. Soumya K. Ghosh** at IIT Kharagpur’s Cloud Computing course (Week 6) dives deep into **cloud security**, covering basic components, attacks, policies, mechanisms, and more. It’s your ultimate study guide for acing that exam! 📚🔒 Let’s break it down with some flair! 😎

## Cloud Security I: Foundations 🔐

### Security - Basic Components 🛡️
Cloud security revolves around three pillars:
- **Confidentiality** 🤫: Keep data and resources hidden from unauthorized eyes.
- **Integrity** ✅: Ensure data stays untampered (data integrity) and comes from a legit source (origin integrity/authenticity).
- **Availability** 🌐: Make sure data and resources are accessible when needed.

### Security Attacks 😈
Any action compromising info security is an attack. Four main types:
1. **Interruption** 🚫: Blocks access to resources (e.g., DDoS).
2. **Interception** 🕵️‍♂️: Steals data in transit (e.g., eavesdropping).
3. **Modification** 🖌️: Alters data to mess with integrity.
4. **Fabrication** 🎭: Fakes data to trick systems into accepting it as legit.

- **Basic Model**: Source → Destination, with attacks disrupting this flow.

*Further Details*:
- **Modification**: Attacks integrity by changing data.
- **Fabrication**: Attacks authenticity by pretending to be legit.

### Classes of Threats ⚠️
Threats fall into three categories:
- **Disclosure** 📢: Unauthorized access to data (e.g., snooping).
- **Deception** 🕵️: Tricking systems/users (e.g., modification, spoofing, repudiation of origin, denial of receipt).
- **Disruption** 🚧: Messing with system operations (e.g., modification, spoofing, delay, denial of service).

### Policies and Mechanisms 📜
- **Policy**: Defines what’s allowed/not allowed, setting the security standard. 🗳️
- **Mechanisms**: Tools to enforce policies (e.g., firewalls, encryption). 🔧
- **Composition**: If policies conflict, vulnerabilities may arise. 😬
- **Goal**: Ensure policies align with security needs.

### Goals of Security 🎯
Security aims to:
- **Prevention** 🛑: Stop attackers from breaking policies.
- **Detection** 🔍: Catch policy violations.
- **Recovery** 🩹: Halt attacks, assess/repair damage, and keep systems running.

### Trust and Assumptions 🤝
Security relies on trust:
- **Policies**: Must clearly define secure vs. insecure states and meet requirements.
- **Mechanisms**: Assumed to enforce policies correctly.
- **Support**: Mechanisms must work as intended.

### Types of Mechanisms ⚙️
Mechanisms vary by scope:
- **Secure**: Fully enforce policy.
- **Precise**: Match policy exactly.
- **Broad**: Cover more than policy requires (may be overkill).

### Assurance 📋
Ensures systems meet security goals:
- **Specification**: Define desired functionality (requirements analysis).
- **Design**: Plan how the system meets specs.
- **Implementation**: Build programs/systems to execute the design.

### Operational Issues 💼
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis** 💸: Is prevention cheaper than recovery?
- **Risk Analysis** ⚖️: What needs protection, and how much?
- **Laws and Customs** 📖: Are security measures legal? Will users adopt them?

### Human Issues 😓
- **Organizational Problems**:
  - Power/responsibility conflicts.
  - Financial incentives misaligned.
- **People Problems**:
  - **Outsiders**: Hackers, attackers.
  - **Insiders**: Rogue employees.
  - **Social Engineering**: Tricking users into giving up info.

### Tying It Together 🧵
Security is a chain: **Threats → Policy → Specification → Design → Implementation → Operation**. Each link must be strong! 💪

### Passive and Active Attacks 🕵️‍♂️
- **Passive Attacks**:
  - Eavesdropping to steal info (hard to detect). 🦻
  - Types:
    - **Release of Message Contents**: Leaking transmission contents.
    - **Traffic Analysis**: Tracking host locations, message patterns.
- **Active Attacks**:
  - Modify or fake data streams. 🖌️
  - Types:
    - **Masquerade**: Pretending to be someone else.
    - **Replay**: Resending captured data for unauthorized effects.
    - **Modification**: Altering legit messages.
    - **Denial of Service (DoS)**: Blocking normal access.

### Security Services 🔒
Cloud security provides:
- **Confidentiality**: Privacy protection. 🤫
- **Authentication**: Verifying data source. 🕵️
- **Integrity**: Ensuring data isn’t altered. ✅
- **Non-repudiation**: Proving actions happened (no denials). 📝
- **Access Control**: Preventing resource misuse. 🚪
- **Availability**: Ensuring resources stay accessible. 🌐
- **Examples**: Blocking DoS attacks, stopping viruses that delete files.

### Role of Security 🛡️
A security infrastructure ensures:
- **Confidentiality**: No privacy leaks.
- **Integrity**: No data tampering.
- **Availability**: No service disruptions.
- **Authentication**: Legit user identification.
- **Authorization**: Controlling user permissions.
- **Non-repudiation**: Tracking actions.
- **Safety**: Protecting against tampering, damage, theft.

### Types of Attacks 😈
- **Social Engineering/Phishing** 🎣: Tricking users.
- **Physical Break-ins/Theft** 🔓: Stealing hardware/data.
- **Password Attacks** 🔑: Cracking credentials.
- **Buffer Overflows** 💾: Exploiting memory errors.
- **Command Injection** 💉: Running malicious commands.
- **Denial of Service** 🚫: Overloading systems.
- **Faulty App Logic** 🐛: Exploiting code flaws.
- **Snooping** 🕵️: Eavesdropping.
- **Packet Manipulation/Fabrication** 📦: Altering/faking network data.
- **Backdoors** 🚪: Hidden system access points.

### Network Security Process 🌐
A six-step approach:
1. **Determine Security Policy** 📜:
   - Define usage, privacy, and update policies.
   - Design network to reflect policy (e.g., DMZs, firewalls, IDS).
   - Train users on passwords, social engineering.
2. **Implement Security Policy** 🛠️:
   - Install firewalls (e.g., iptables for Linux) with strict rules.
   - Deploy IDS (e.g., Snort) for alerts/logs.
   - Use honeypots (e.g., honeyd) as decoys.
3. **Reconnaissance** 🔎:
   - Learn network details (IP addresses, key servers, services).
   - **Passive**: Undetectable (e.g., sniffing).
   - **Active**: Detectable by IDS (e.g., scanning).
4. **Vulnerability Scanning** 🩺:
   - Target hosts/services for weaknesses.
   - Tools like Nessus (risk reports) or Metasploit (exploits).
   - Update scanners with plugins (e.g., NASL).
5. **Penetration Testing** 💥:
   - Exploit vulnerabilities to gain access.
   - Use frameworks like Metasploit or custom exploits.
   - Test for new vulnerabilities in user inputs.
6. **Post-Attack Investigation** 🕵️‍♂️:
   - Conduct forensics (guided by laws).
   - Use third parties to retain evidence chain.
   - Analyze logs, disk copies (not originals).

### Firewall and IDS Details 🔥
- **Firewall Types**:
  - **Packet Filter**: Filters by IP, port, protocol.
  - **Stateful**: Tracks TCP sessions, discards out-of-session packets.
  - **Application Proxy**: Scans all layers for malicious data.
- **IDS**: Scans messages, alerts on suspected attacks.
- **Honeypot/Honeynet**: Decoy systems to trap attackers.
